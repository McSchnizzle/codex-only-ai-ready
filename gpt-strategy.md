## 3. On‑Prem & Secure Cloud AI Offer (Copy)

You can use this on the website, proposals, and one‑pager.

### Section Title: Private & secure AI options

**Intro paragraph:**

Some organizations can’t send sensitive data to public AI services. We understand. We’ve spent decades working in industries where privacy, IP protection, and compliance matter. That’s why AI Support PDX offers both **on‑premises** and **locked‑down cloud** options.

---

### On‑Prem AI Appliance

**Headline:** On‑prem AI, installed and supported

**Copy:**

For teams with strict data, regulatory, or IP requirements, we can deploy a local AI appliance on your own network — for example, a compact NVIDIA DGX Spark‑class box.

Our **On‑Prem AI Appliance package** includes:

* Hardware selection and procurement support
* On‑site installation and network configuration
* Secure base image, patching, and hardening
* Installation of one or more private AI models for:

  * Local chat and analysis
  * Coding assistance for your dev team
  * Private document Q&A
* Admin documentation and a clear “how to use this safely” guide for your staff

**Pricing:**

* Approx. **$10,000** one‑time for initial setup and configuration
* **$1,000/month** for 6 months of support:

  * Ongoing patching and monitoring guidance
  * Configuration changes as your use cases evolve
  * Monthly check‑ins and Q&A with your team

We’ll help you decide if on‑prem is truly necessary. If a secure cloud setup is sufficient, we’ll recommend that path instead.

---

### Secure Cloud AI Environments

**Headline:** Lock down AI in the cloud

**Copy:**

For many organizations, a properly configured cloud environment gives the best balance of security, flexibility, and cost.

We design and implement:

* **Azure AI environments**

  * Private networking and endpoints
  * “On your data” configurations so models can work with your documents without exposing them publicly

* **AWS AI environments**

  * Private VPC configurations
  * Access to foundation models through secure endpoints
  * Integration with your existing AWS services where appropriate

In both cases, we:

* Work with your existing IT / security teams
* Document architecture and policies in plain language
* Train your staff on what’s safe to do with AI tools and what should stay in your core systems

Our goal is simple: **use AI where it helps, without creating new risk.**

Build a production-ready marketing website for **AI Support PDX**, a new service by Vital Enterprises based in Portland, Oregon.

### Tech Requirements

- Use a simple, modern stack:
  - A static site with `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`, OR
  - A minimal React + Vite or Next.js app (if you prefer).
- The site must be:
  - Mobile-first and responsive,
  - Accessible (semantic HTML, proper headings, alt text, keyboard-friendly),
  - Easy to deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

If you choose React/Next, still keep the codebase small, well-organized, and easy for a small team to maintain.

- Byline: A Vital Enterprises company
- Primary tagline: **"Experienced tech leaders for your AI journey."**
- Visual style:

### Navigation

- Contact

Each nav item should scroll smoothly to the appropriate section on the single-page layout.

#### WHO WE HELP SECTION

Section heading:
Who we help

Intro:
We work with mostly non-technical organizations that want to use AI but don’t want to become technology companies.

Use these as cards or bullet groups:

- Home & field services  
  Tree services, landscaping, HVAC, plumbing, and similar service businesses looking to improve scheduling, quoting, and follow-up.

- Coffee & food businesses  
  Roasters, cafés, and food producers that want better customer communication and web presence.

- Professional practices  
  Dental, legal, accounting, and clinic teams looking to streamline intake, reminders, and client communication.

- Manufacturers & distributors  
  Smaller operations that want better visibility into orders, inventory, and customer needs.

- Nonprofits & regional organizations  
  Community-focused organizations that need to do more with limited staff while protecting sensitive data.

#### WHAT WE DO SECTION

Section heading:
What we do

Intro paragraph:
We help you understand where AI fits in your business, then design and implement solutions that your team can actually use. No labs. No experiments for their own sake. Just practical improvements.

Subsections (you can display these as four or five columns/cards):

Strategy & roadmaps  
We start with how your business really works today. Then we identify high-ROI use cases, build a simple 6–12 month roadmap, and check in regularly as AI evolves.

Automation & agents  
We design small internal tools and automations — from smarter scheduling and intake forms to AI-assisted report generation — using agentic coding tools, with experienced engineers reviewing every step.

Marketing & outreach  
We use AI to refresh your website copy, improve your search presence, draft content calendars, and help you set up ethical, targeted cold outreach.

Training & enablement  
We run executive briefings, all-staff AI 101, and developer bootcamps so the people who will use AI day-to-day feel confident and safe.

Data & private AI  
We help you bring together key data in platforms like Snowflake or Databricks, then build private AI assistants and environments — on-prem or in secure cloud — that respect your privacy requirements.

## 7. Logo & Graphics Prompts (Final)

### Logo – Icon + Wordmark

> Create a flat vector logo for a company called “AI Support PDX”. The concept is a simple evergreen tree made from connected dots and lines, symbolizing both the Pacific Northwest and AI networks. Style: minimal, modern, professional, and reassuring (reflecting a 30-year tech legacy), not playful or experimental. Use a limited palette of deep forest green, slate blue, and a touch of teal on a light background. Include a clean sans-serif wordmark “AI Support PDX” to the right of the icon. No gradients, no 3D, suitable for web and print.

### Logo – Wordmark Only

> Design a clean wordmark logo that says “AI Support PDX”. Style: modern sans-serif with slightly rounded corners, professional but inviting. The logo should feel established, as if the company has been in tech leadership for decades. Emphasize “AI” subtly, perhaps with a different weight or color. Use deep forest green and dark grey on a white or light neutral background. No icon, just typography.

### Website Hero Illustration

> Create an illustration for a website hero section. Scene: a Portland-style small business environment (for example, a coffee shop storefront and a landscaping truck) with subtle hints of AI, like soft connection lines or gently glowing nodes around tools and devices. Style: flat, minimal, slightly geometric, with a Pacific Northwest color palette of greens, blues, and warm neutrals. The overall feeling should be calm competence: “we’ve done this before,” not “shiny startup.” No text in the image. 16:9 wide aspect ratio for use as a web banner.

### Icon Set

> Create a set of 4 flat vector icons in a consistent style, outlined with minimal fills. Icons: (1) Strategy & roadmaps (a simple path with a flag), (2) Automation & agents (two gears with a small spark or node), (3) Training & enablement (a person at a whiteboard with a lightbulb), (4) Private AI & security (a shield with small nodes). Colors: deep forest green, slate blue, and teal accents on a light neutral background. The style should be modern and professional, appropriate for a consulting company with a long history in tech.

## 9. Cold Outreach Email Campaign (4 Emails, Final)

### Email 1 – Intro & free consult

**Subject options:**

* Free AI readiness session for your business this December
* Quick question about AI and {{CompanyName}}

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

I’m {{YourName}} with **AI Support PDX**, part of the Vital Enterprises family here in Portland. Our group includes companies like VTM (over 30 years leading global tech consortiums) and Novus Labs (17+ years working on complex consumer electronics products).

We’ve been working with AI‑enabled products and tools for several years and are already helping organizations in the region with their AI strategy. Now we’re opening that expertise up to more local businesses and nonprofits through AI Support PDX.

To help organizations get ready for 2026, we’re offering a **free AI Readiness Session** for a limited number of Portland‑area teams.

In a 60–90 minute session, we will:

* Walk through how your business currently finds customers, delivers work, and follows up
* Identify 3–5 concrete ways AI could save time or grow revenue
* Talk through options ranging from simple tools to private, secure AI environments
* Send you a 1‑page summary you can share with your team

No prep work required — just a conversation about how {{CompanyName}} runs today and where AI might actually help.

Would you be open to a quick call to see if this would be useful for you?

Best,
{{YourName}}
AI Support PDX · A Vital Enterprises company
[Phone]
[Website]

P.S. If you’d rather not receive emails about AI from me, just reply with “no thanks” and I’ll take you off the list.

### Email 2 – Examples & credibility

**Subject options:**

* Two simple AI wins for teams like yours
* A practical way AI can help {{CompanyName}} next quarter

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

Following up on my note about the free AI Readiness Session.

Because we sit across more than a dozen companies, we’re seeing the same AI patterns repeat — what actually works, where the limits are, and what’s just hype. For businesses like {{CompanyName}}, the first wins are usually very practical:

* **Better scheduling & follow‑up**
  AI can help triage inbound requests, draft quotes or appointment confirmations, and remind your team when it’s time to follow up — without replacing your existing systems.

* **Smarter web presence**
  We can use AI to refresh website copy, improve how you show up in search, and answer common questions via a simple chatbot, so your staff spend less time on repetitive calls and emails.

In the past, we’ve built scheduling tools that teams used daily for years. With today’s AI and agentic coding tools, we can build the “2.0 version” of that kind of system much faster, often in weeks instead of months.

If you’re curious what this might look like for {{CompanyName}}, we can talk through it in a free December session and leave you with a 1‑page plan for Q1 2026.

Would you like a couple of time options?

Best,
{{YourName}}

P.S. Even if we never work together beyond the consult, you’ll walk away with concrete ideas you can reuse.

---

### Email 3 – Privacy / security & objections

**Subject options:**

* Worried about AI and confidentiality?
* We can keep your AI off the public internet.

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

A concern we hear a lot is:

> “We’re nervous about putting our data into AI tools. We can’t afford a leak or a mistake.”

That’s a very reasonable concern — and it’s exactly why we built AI Support PDX around **private and secure AI options**.

Depending on your needs, we can:

* Keep everything on‑prem with a local AI appliance running on your own network
* Or run AI in a locked‑down Azure or AWS environment that doesn’t expose your data to the public internet
* Train your team on what’s safe to put into AI tools and what should stay in your internal systems

The goal isn’t to replace people — it’s to give your existing team better tools while keeping your data safe.

If security has been your main blocker with AI, the free December AI Readiness Session is a good chance to ask the hard questions and see what’s actually possible.

Would you be open to a quick call to schedule a session?

Best,
{{YourName}}

---

### Email 4 – Breakup + small value

**Subject options:**

* Should I close the loop on AI for {{CompanyName}}?
* Last quick note about AI for your team

**Body:**

Hi {{FirstName}},

I know your inbox is busy, so this will be my last note unless you’d like to continue the conversation.

We still have a few spots for our **free December AI Readiness Sessions** for Portland‑area organizations. After that, we’ll be focused on kicking off 2026 projects with our early clients.

Even if we never work together, here are three questions you can use internally to sanity‑check AI ideas:

1. Where are we copying and pasting the same information over and over?
2. Where do customers or staff wait the longest for a response?
3. What information do we have that never gets used to make decisions?

Those are usually the best starting points for small AI projects with real impact.

If you’d like help answering those questions for {{CompanyName}}, I’m happy to set up a free session. Otherwise, no worries — I’ll close the loop here.

Best,
{{YourName}}

P.S. Reply with “no thanks” if you’d prefer not to hear from me about this again.

---

If you want to move fast today, I’d start by:

1. Dropping the **web‑dev prompt** into Claude Code / Lovable / Replit and generating version 1 of AISupportPDX.com.
2. Using the **logo prompt** to generate a few identity options.
3. Feeding the **one‑pager copy and design prompt** into your creative tool to get a PDF ready for outreach.

You can then tune everything based on real conversations from the December sessions.
